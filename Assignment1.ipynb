In order to avoid the problem for (\"Na\") being divided into (\"N\", \"a\"), this function also looks at the letter following the capitalized letter to see if there is a lowercase character following it. Now our variable `el` contains the name of our element.

It is in this part that the matrix is created, where the rows represent the individual elements and the columns represent the molecules (the reactants first, and the products after). \n",

In this last part, we find the solutions to equilibrate the reaction and find the correct stoechiometry using the stated law to construct an equation for our matrix. The function `.nullspace()` returns a list of basis vector, where each vector in the nullspace is a possible answer for the ratios of coefficients. In other words, the `.nullspace()` of a matrix A is the set of all vectors x such that A⋅x=0. The following equation is true as this is the set of possible coefficient combinations that conserve every element. \n",
